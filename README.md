# graph_search
## This is a very VERY simple implementation of elementary graph based code without touching things such as:
1) architecture controllers trained with reinforcement learning (RL), 
2) differentiable methods, and 
3) evolutionary algorithms.

The issue being 'solved' here only requires simple graph search methods and have no need for GNN (phew!)
